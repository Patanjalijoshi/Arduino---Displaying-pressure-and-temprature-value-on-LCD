# Arduino---Displaying-pressure-value-on-LCD
This project involves the interfacing of a pressure & temprature sensor and a LCD display to display the pressure reading. 



### Componects used:
* Arduino Mega 2560 (The code will be compatable with the Arduino uno as well) 
* LCD 
* I2C module
* BMP180 Pressure sensor
